# AshTalk
A web app to cater to various mental health related issues people might face in the school. This app allows students the ability to go on the platform and talk to some (counsellor or student) about things that might be bothering the person. The student would have to pick a category into which their issues fall so as to be directed to someone with more or similar experience in the field, to create a sense of empathy when they chat. The chat could be either anonymous or not based on the students discretion. Counsellors though would be given the ability to override as students anonymous state based on special terms and conditions.
